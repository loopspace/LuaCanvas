	  About LuaCanvas
	</div>
	<div id="main">
	  <p>
	    Lua Canvas combines the simplicity of
	    the <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua programming
	    language</a> with the power of
	    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML5
	    canvas element</a>.
	    The goal is to create a playground where it is possible to
	    easily create graphical programs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is heavily inspired by the awesome iPad App
	    <a href="http://codea.io/">Codea</a> which is a fantastic
	    environment in which to simply have fun while learning to
	    program.  The only downside of Codea is that it only runs
	    on an iPad, making it impractical to use as a teaching
	    tool where iPads are not already in use.  Thus LuaCanvas
	    was developed to provide the same experience but more
	    widely available.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Although inspired by Codea and with many features borrowed
	    from Codea, it is not a clone.  Both consist of a Lua
	    interpreter with extra commands that are primarily aimed
	    at making it easy to do some graphical programming.  The
	    key difference is where those commands are processed.  In
	    LuaCanvas, the program is given access to an HTML5 Canvas
	    element and the commands are tailored to its capabilities
	    (for the moment, just using a 2D context).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The components involved in designing LuaCanvas were:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li><strong>Lua</strong>: The Lua language is very
	      straightforward and compact.  There aren't lots of
	      confusing ways to achieve the same ends but it is
	      nevertheless an extremely capable language.  It is a
	      very good first (or second) written programming
	      language.
	    <li><strong>Graphics</strong>: The great thing about
	      Codea was that it gave you an easy way to do graphical
	      programming.  It itself was following in the tradition
	      of Processing.  Graphics is <em>fun</em>, but also
	      with a high education potential.  It is hard to do
	      much without any mathematics.
	    <li><strong>Browser</strong>: The goal was to make
	      LuaCanvas work anywhere without installing any software.
	      This effectively meant that it had to work in a
	      browser as that can be reliably assumed to exist on
	      every computer.
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    All of these considerations led to the choice of using a
	    Lua VM compiled into JavaScript with extra functions that
	    give the Lua code access to an HTML5 Canvas element.  It
	    is hoped that this will prove to be an enjoyable
	    environment in which to learn some programming (and
	    mathematics).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    LuaCanvas is built using:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://kripken.github.io/lua.vm.js/lua.vm.js.html">Lua
		VM</a> compiled into JavaScript.  (Actually, it uses a
	      slight modification of that project.)
	    <li><a href="https://codemirror.net/">Code Mirror</a>
	      for the editing environment.
	    <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and parts of
	    the <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a> to make
	    life easier in the code. 
	  </ul>
